2. Infrastructure components are properly configured
3. Security measures are in place
4. Monitoring and alerting are operational
5. Documentation is complete and accurate

## Next Steps
1. Run full infrastructure test:
```powershell
./scripts/test-infrastructure.ps1 -AwsRegion "us-east-1" -Environment "production" -ApiEndpoint "https://api.equity-shield-advocates.com"
```

2. Verify deployment:
```powershell
./scripts/verify-deployment.ps1 -AwsRegion "us-east-1" -Environment "production" -ApiEndpoint "https://api.equity-shield-advocates.com"
```

3. Monitor the application for 24 hours to ensure stability
4. Review CloudWatch logs and metrics
5. Verify backup and disaster recovery procedures
